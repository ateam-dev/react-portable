## ü¶Ñ What is Previewify?

Previewify is a revolutionary tool aimed at streamlining the component library development process. If you've ever found yourself stuck in the time-consuming cycle of developing a component, testing it in Storybook, publishing it, installing it in an application, and then discovering it doesn't work as expected‚ÄîPreviewify is for you.

This tool allows you to preview locally developed components directly in a live, deployed application, essentially cutting out the middle steps of publishing and reinstalling. No more worrying about style breaks or unexpected behaviors after deployment; see your changes in the actual environment where they will be used. Previewify aims to accelerate your development cycle and bridge the gap between component development and its real-world implementation.

### üåü Features

- **üñº Non-Intrusive Previews**: Preview your components on a deployed page without affecting the behavior of the service or the user experience.
- **üåê Tunneling Support**: Provides globally accessible URLs via tunneling, making it easier to preview components on various devices, including mobile.
- **üîã Hot-Reload**: Automatically reflects any changes you make to your local components in real-time during the preview.

When you start Previewify, two servers get spun up: a component delivery server and a gateway proxy. Here's a simple step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Initialize Servers**: Running Previewify initializes two servers: a component delivery server for serving your local components and a gateway proxy for intercepting requests to the deployed application.
2. **Access Through Gateway**: You open the deployed application through the gateway URL. At this stage, a script is injected via the proxy server, activating the preview mode on the application.
3. **Enter Preview Mode**: Once preview mode is activated, the application starts requesting the components from the component delivery server.
4. **Component Replacement**: The components in the live application are dynamically replaced with the ones from your local component delivery server, allowing you to preview how your local changes would appear in the deployed application.

By understanding this mechanism, you can effectively utilize Previewify to speed up your development process.

## üç≠ How to Use

### üìã Prerequisites

- React v18 or higher
- Written in Typescript
- Built with Vite

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Install the necessary packages using npm or Yarn as follows:

```bash
# for npm
npm install -D @react-portable/core @builder.io/qwik@1.2.8 @builder.io/qwik-city@1.2.8 @builder.io/qwik-react@0.5.0

# for yarn
yarn add -D @react-portable/core @builder.io/qwik@1.2.8 @builder.io/qwik-city@1.2.8 @builder.io/qwik-react@0.5.0
```

The `@react-portable/core` package contains Previewify, and `qwik` packages are necessary for its functionality.

### üéÅ Importing and Wrapping Components

To start, you'll first need to import and wrap your component using Previewify's `previewify` function.

Here is a simplified example:

::: code-group
```tsx [./src/components/MyComponent.tsx]
import { FC } from "react";
import { previewify } from "@react-portable/core";

type Props = {
  // Your component props
};

const Component: FC<Props> = (props) => {
  // Your component code
};

export const MyComponent = previewify(Component, "unique-code");
```
:::

In this example, the `previewify` function wraps `MyComponent`, and you provide a unique identifier code as the second argument. Make sure the identifier is unique across your project to avoid conflicts.

### üöÄ Deploying to Live Application

After you've wrapped your component with previewify, the next step is to import this wrapped component into your live application. Make sure to deploy these changes to your production or staging environment. This is essential for Previewify to be able to preview this component in an environment that closely mimics your live application.

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom Configuration

You can customize Previewify's settings by placing a configuration file in your project root. Create `previewify.config.ts` at the root of your project.

To configure Previewify, you'll use the `previewifyPlugin` for Vite.

Here's a sample configuration:

::: code-group
```ts [previewify.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { previewifyPlugin } from "@react-portable/core/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // Insert any required Vite plugins for your build process (e.g., tsconfigPaths)
    previewifyPlugin({ 
      entry: "./src/entry.ts",
      css: "./src/global.css",
    }),
  ],
});
```
:::

#### üéöÔ∏è Parameters for `previewifyPlugin`

- `entry` (Optional): Specify the entry file for your project if it is not located at `./src/index.(ts|js|tsx|jsx)`.
- `css` (Optional): If you have a global CSS file (such as one for Tailwind CSS), specify its path here.


### üèéÔ∏è Starting Preview

Once the wrapped component is deployed in your live environment, you can now use Previewify's command-line utility to preview it:

```bash
npx portable prevewify 'https://your.page.com'
```

Upon successful execution, you should see output similar to this:


```bash
...
‚úì built in 561ms
[mf:inf] Ready on http://127.0.0.1:55349/
üìÅ Serving static files from .portable/client
üöÄ Loading server entry .portable/server/worker.mjs
[mf:inf] Ready on http://127.0.0.1:8787/
üü¢ Previewing at http://127.0.0.1:8787 (proxy ~> https://your.page.com)
```

::: info
If your project's entry file is not located at `./src/index.(ts|js|tsx|jsx)`, starting the preview server as mentioned above will not work as expected. Please refer to the [Custom Configuration](#custom-configuration) section.
:::

Open the displayed URL in your web browser; in this example, it would be http://127.0.0.1:8787.

You should see a preview button and status at the bottom of the page, similar to the image below:

![preview footer](/preview-button.png)

Clicking this button will initiate the preview, allowing you to see the component in the context of your live application.


#### üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Options

`npx portable previewify [options] <origin>`

- `origin`: Specify the origin (protocol + domain) of the page you want to preview. This should be the base URL (e.g., `https://example.com`) where you want to see your component previews.
- `-p`, `--port <port>`: Specifies the port for the gateway server.
- `-w`, `--watch <path>`:  If you want to watch for file changes in a specific directory, provide the `<path>` here to automatically restart the server. Enabling this option also allows hot-reloading of components during preview, making sure your changes are reflected in real-time.
- `-t`, `--tunnel`: Use Cloudflared tunnel to make the local server globally accessible. Default is `false`.

Usage

```bash
npx portable previewify 'https://your.page.com' --watch ./src --tunnel
```

## üéì TIPs for Effective Use
### üé® Using Tailwind with Both Component Library and Application
During previews, you don't need reset CSS. Prepare a separate CSS file that omits `@tailwind base;` specifically for Previewify and set its path in your `previewify.config.ts`.

Here is an example:

::: code-group
```css [./src/previewify.css]
/**
 * Tailwind CSS imports
 * View the full documentation at https://tailwindcss.com
 */
/*@tailwind base;*/
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
```ts [./previewify.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { previewifyPlugin } from "@react-portable/core/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [previewifyPlugin({ css: "./src/previewify.css" })],
});
```
:::

To avoid style conflicts due to CSS overrides, you can set the `important` option in your `tailwind.config.js`.

::: code-group
```js [tailwind.config.js]
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"],
  important: "rp-preview",  // set this to scope styles
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
};
```
:::

Setting `important` to `"rp-preview"` ensures that Tailwind styles are scoped to this specific area, avoiding global overrides that might interfere with your existing styles.

### üéõÔ∏è Overriding Props for Preview Purposes

Sometimes, the props type of the component you are currently modifying locally may differ from the deployed component in production, making the preview unworkable. The `previewify` function accepts a third argument, `options`, that you can use to override props for such cases.

```tsx
export const MyComponent = previewify(Component, "unique-code", { 
  props: { /* your overridden props here */ }
});
```

::: info
Overriding props in this manner is intended solely for previewing purposes. You don't need to specify this during the actual deployment to production.
:::

### üåê When The Response from the Origin has a Content-Type of `br`

If the response from the origin server has a `Content-Type: br` header, you must enable tunneling mode for the preview to work properly.

To enable tunneling mode, use the `--tunnel` flag when running the preview command:

```bash
npx portable previewify 'https://your.page.com' --tunnel
```

By using tunneling mode, Previewify will be able to handle br (Brotli) compressed content correctly, ensuring that your previews display as expected.

## üîÆ Future Features
We have several features planned for future releases:

- Fixed domain during tunneling
